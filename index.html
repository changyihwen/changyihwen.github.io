			<p>Main Content : Hey there, welcome to my page. Over here is where I try to polish up on some of my skills that have gone rusty over the years. I have worked on various stuffs from illustrations to design, photography then to videos and also web development. My constant switching have led me to the situation now whereby I know something about everything but not skilled in any one area. Thus in an attempt to consolidate my skillset. I will try to re-skill myself using GitHub as a version control tool to chart my learning journey.</p>
